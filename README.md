# Freecode-Algorithms
Projects of the Javascript Alforithms and Data Structure Certification of Freecodecamp.org 

These are the five projects needed to obtain the FreeCodeCamp certification of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. I also did a basic interface to be able to easily test some of them. 

The only one that has no visual interface is the Cash Register project. It consists of design a function that accepts purchase price as the first argument, payment as the second, and cash-in-drawer (2D array listing available currency) as the third. Then, the function should always return an object with a status key with the state of the cash register as the value and a change key with the change due as the value.

The Phone number validator return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

Next, Caesar cipher. A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on. For this project is needed to write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

On the other hand, the Roman numeral converter should convert the given number into a roman numeral.

Finally, The Palindrome checker Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
